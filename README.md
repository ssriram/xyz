xyz - a simple hackable scripting language for simply hacking!

- a small scheme like implementation born out of pure hobby hacking.
- its obvious to find that many languages differ only in functionality and not in syntax
while some differ only in syntax and not in functionality. keeping in mind that
some are very elegant in syntax and some very elegant in functionality,
i was wondering how it would look if i could bridge some of these
syntactics and functionalities into one single language?
